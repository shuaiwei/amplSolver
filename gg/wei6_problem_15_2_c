The way to do that is :
1) Find the first element b of the entering node set EN.
2) In original arc set A, replace all the same element in A with EN by b; such as replacing 
   arc (a,c) and (e,d) with (a,b) and (b,d) if c and d are the same elements, respectively.
3) delete the arc having the same start and end point, namely delete (e,e);
5) In the origal node set, delete all elements that are same to these in entering set EN 
    except b.
4) Put the new generated A and N into algorithm;
5) Do the totally same things to the exiting node set EX.
6) Then, by just changing the arc and node sets in new algorithm, we can get the max flow from 
   one subset to another.
